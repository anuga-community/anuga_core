ARR design rainfall data
========================

This appendix shows how to get the data for an Australian Rainfall and Runoff
(ARR 2016) design storm and load it for :class:`ARR_rate_operator`. See
:doc:`../setup_anuga_script/rainfall` for how the operator is used.

A design storm needs two things from two different places:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 35 40

   * - Input
     - Source
     - ANUGA class
   * - Rainfall depth at each location (IFD grids)
     - Bureau of Meteorology `Design Rainfall Data System`_
     - :class:`Arr_ifd_rain`, :class:`Arr_grd`
   * - How that depth falls over time (temporal patterns)
     - `ARR Data Hub`_
     - :class:`Arr_hub_rain`, :class:`ARR_point_rainfall_patterns`,
       :class:`Single_pattern`


IFD grids
---------

Download the grids in a browser. The Bureau's
`copyright notice <https://www.bom.gov.au/copyright>`_ does not allow automated
extraction from its site, so don't script this step, and check its terms before
you redistribute the grids, for example in a repository.

1. On the `Design Rainfall Data System`_, choose **Extent** and enter the
   lower-left and upper-right corners of a box around your catchment. The grid
   cells are 0.025° (about 2.5 km), so leave a margin of a cell or two.
2. Select **Submit**. The results panel stays empty.
3. Use the download buttons at the top of the page, and keep the page open until
   the zip file arrives.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 30 20 20

   * - File
     - AEPs (%)
     - ``Frq``
     - Grids
   * - ``IFD_Extent.zip``
     - 63.212, 50, 39.347, 20, 18.127, 10, 5, 2, 1
     - 63212 … 1000
     - 261
   * - ``Rare_Extent.zip``
     - 1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05
     - 1000 … 50
     - 145
   * - ``Very_frequent_Extent.zip``
     - 99.999, 99.752, 98.168, 95.021, 86.466, 63.212, 39.347, 18.127
     - 99999 … 18127
     - 232

Each probability comes in the 29 standard durations, from 1 minute to 7 days.

.. tip::

   Download the sets one at a time. The all-patterns button sends all 522 requests
   at once and builds the zip file only when they have all finished. A request
   that fails does not produce an error message: the counter just stops, and the
   grids already received are lost when you reload.

Put the zip files, under any name, in one directory:

.. code-block:: python

   from anuga.rain import Arr_ifd_rain

   ifd = Arr_ifd_rain('/data/lismore_ifd', Lat=-28.81, Lon=153.28)
   grd = ifd.open_grd(Dur=1440, aep_percent=1.0)   # 24 hours, 1% AEP

:meth:`Arr_ifd_rain.open_grd` raises ``ValueError``, listing what is available, if
no grid matches.

.. warning::

   ``aep_percent`` is the clearer way to choose a grid. If you use ``Frq``, it is
   the label in the file name, which is the AEP in percent times 1000, not a return
   period: ``Frq=1000`` (``01000aep``) is 1% AEP and ``Frq=100`` (``00100aep``) is
   0.1% AEP, or 1 in 1000. Earlier versions of these docs gave ``Frq=100`` for 1%,
   which opens a much rarer storm without any warning if ``Rare_Extent.zip`` is
   present.

Then read the depth at each centroid. The grids are in latitude and longitude
(GDA94), so convert the mesh's coordinates first:

.. code-block:: python

   from anuga.coordinate_transforms.redfearn import epsg_to_ll

   xy = domain.get_centroid_coordinates(absolute=True)
   lats, lons = epsg_to_ll(xy[:, 0], xy[:, 1], domain.get_epsg())
   depth_array = grd.get_rain_at_points(lons, lats)   # mm

Each point takes the value of the grid cell holding it, so the depths are in
steps of about 2.5 km.

* **Outside the grid:** a point outside the extent raises ``ValueError``.
* **Ocean:** the grids hold 0, not NODATA, over the ocean. A point on such a cell
  gets no rain, and gives a warning. Check this on a coastal model, where a cell
  near the shore could read 0 while the centroid in it is on land.
* **NODATA:** a NODATA cell gives NaN and a warning, and
  :class:`ARR_rate_operator` raises an error if NaN falls on a cell it acts on.


Temporal patterns
-----------------

Enter your catchment on the `ARR Data Hub`_, tick the data you want, including
**Temporal Patterns**, and submit. Save the results with **Download TXT**, and
download the patterns from the **Download (.zip)** link beside them.

.. code-block:: python

   from anuga.rain import Arr_hub_rain, ARR_point_rainfall_patterns, Single_pattern

   hub = Arr_hub_rain('lismore_hub_export.txt')
   prp = ARR_point_rainfall_patterns('Point_ECsouth.zip', hub.Tpat_code)

Each zip file holds 720 patterns. Each of the 24 durations, from 10 minutes to
7 days, has ten patterns in each of three groups: ``frequent``, ``intermediate``
and ``rare``.
``prp.linesInc`` has one row per pattern, after a header row, with the duration in
column 1 and the group in column 4. This picks the ten for a rare 24-hour storm:

.. code-block:: python

   rows = [i for i, row in enumerate(prp.linesInc)
           if i > 0 and int(row[1]) == 1440 and row[4].strip() == 'rare']
   pattern = Single_pattern(prp, index=rows[0])

ARR 2016 runs a storm with each of the ten patterns and works from the set of
results, so a single pattern is not a design answer on its own.


Running the storm
-----------------

.. code-block:: python

   from anuga.rain import ARR_rate_operator

   rain = ARR_rate_operator(domain, depth_array, pattern, ifd_duration=grd.dur)

``ifd_duration`` warns if the grid and the pattern have different durations.
End each ``yieldstep`` on the pattern's time steps to deliver the exact depth.


What ANUGA does not do for you
------------------------------

ANUGA applies the depths and pattern as they are. These are yours to handle:

* **Climate baseline.** The Bureau's grids are its 2016 values. The ARR Data Hub
  also tabulates the same IFDs adjusted for climate change, and by default shows a
  current climate (2030) table. At Lismore, the 24-hour 1% AEP depth is 353 mm in
  the native table and 388 mm in the 2030 table. To use an adjusted depth, scale
  ``depth_array``.
* **Areal reduction.** A depth from the grids is a point rainfall. The hub's ARF
  parameters are read by :class:`Arr_hub_rain` as strings and not applied.
* **Losses.** The hub's initial and continuing losses are read and not applied.
  :class:`Arr_hub_rain` reads the ``[LOSSES]`` section, which the hub now labels as
  superseded where it has newer values, so check the hub's results for the losses
  it recommends.
* **Jurisdiction guidance.** Some states have their own guidance on losses and
  pre-burst rainfall. The ARR Data Hub has jurisdiction pages, including NSW, and
  this can matter a lot for rare storms.
* **Areal temporal patterns.** ARR 2016 has separate patterns for larger catchments.
  The steps above use the point patterns.
